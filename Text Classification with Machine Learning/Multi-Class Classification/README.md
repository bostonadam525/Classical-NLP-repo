# Multi-Class Text Classification
* A repo with various machine learning experiments and techniques for multi-class text classification.

* Also known as **single-label classification**, involves categorizing data into mutually exclusive classes.
* Each data point belongs to **1 and only 1 class**
* This makes multi-class classification most useful for scenarios where items can be **distinctly assigned to 1 category.**
