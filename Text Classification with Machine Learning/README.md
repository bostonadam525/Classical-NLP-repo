# Text Classification with Machine Learning
* This repo contains Text Classification projects and experiments using "classical" supervised machine learing algorithms (not deep learning or transformers).
* Some of the most common text classification machine learning algorithms used in this repo:
1. Logistic regression
2. Naive Bayes
3. SVM
4. KNN
5. XGBoost
6. Random Forest
