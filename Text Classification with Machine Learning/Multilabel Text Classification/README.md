# Multilabel Text Classification
* This repo contains examples and experiments using various machine learning models to perform multilabel text classification.

* Multi-label classification is ideal for data that can be associated with **multiple labels simultaneously.**
* This technique is most useful for machine learning tasks where data points may belong to **more than one class at the same time.**
