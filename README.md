# Classical-NLP-repo
* by Adam Lang
* A repo with "classical NLP" techniques. Things we used to do and still do before there were LLMs.
* When I think of the word "classical" I think of classical music such as Mozart or Beethoven. Without classical music we wouldn't have the music of today such as blues, jazz, rock, alternative and rap.
* There are many musicians who studied classical music an brought it into their modern style of play such as Eddie Van Halen.
* We also have to remember that classical music gives us the structure and backbone of everything in music today.

## So what does "classical NLP" have to do with classical music?
* Classical NLP techniques form the backbone of modern natural language processing (NLP).
* Before there were transformers, LLMs, and attention models there were simple libraries and functions (mostly in Python) that are still utilized today with or without LLMs.
* The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate some of those techniques.
