# Part of Speech Tagging
* A repo for all things part of speech tagging with experiments and links.


# Background
* When most NLP practitioners think of POS tagging, they think of simple out of the box solutions like spacy or NLTK.
* While these get the job done, there are other options to consider depending on your dataset and use case.
* I will list some resources to checkout by group below.
* At a high level, the main approaches to POS Tagging are:
1. Rule based
2. Stochastic
3. Deep Learning
* Having said that, there are more granular ways to break this down, but I refer you to the links below.


## Out of the box frameworks
* spacy
* NLTK
* TextBlob
* Polyglot
* Flair
* BERTopic

## Stochastic Models
* A stochastic approach includes frequency, probability or statistics.
* The most common approach for this is a Hidden Markov Model.

## Deep Learning/Neural Networks
* RNN
* BiRNN
* LSTM
* BiLSTM
* CNN
* ELMo
* ULMFiT
* Transformers
  * Encoders (e.g. BERT, GliNER)
  * Decoders (e.g. GPT)
  * Encoder-Decoders (e.g. T5, BART, etc.)
* Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
* LSTM-CRF
* GRU-CRF
