# RxNorm N-gram data engineering
* This is a demo folder of some data engineering work I did in Python to data wrangle and transform RxNorm text files.
* RxNorm text data is formatted in a specific way and this demonstrates manipulation of the n-grams to align with EHR specific standards and clinical natural language.
* This work was done before LLMs and GPT models were being utilized.
